# plesk-nginx-wprocket
My optimized settings for Plesk Onyx Nginx only and WP Rocket Plugin.

<b>Tested with Plesk Onyx Plesk Onyx Version 17.8.11 Update #35, December 22, 2018.</b>

This is a collection of various (tested) configuration snippets I've found in the last couple of years.

Whilst this might NOT be the most elegant solution, I found it to be extremely effective on a working server. 


I enclude  my additional nginx directives for Plesk Onyx.
Please add those here: 
HOSTING SERVICES --> DOMAINS --> yourdomain.com --> Apache & nginx Settings -> Additional nginx directives.
Additional notes:

* I'm using pure Nginx without Apache
* Tested with PHP 7.3
* Nginx was compiled using script by VirtuBox -->> https://github.com/VirtuBox/nginx-ee
